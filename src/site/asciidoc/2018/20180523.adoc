== From wordpress to maven-site

_Posted on {post-date}_

The last weeks I worked on swtiching my website away from wordpress and now it's finally there. Basically I use know the maven site plugin to generate the site out of asciidoc files. To be able to do this I've created a small plugin which is able to read a YML definition which includes all blog posts and create some asciidoc with it which is then later generated to HTML via maven site plugin. More details to come soon (maybe) ;)

My basic requirements were:

* support easy markup without the need to write HTML directly
* source code support (with highlightning)
* easy way to publish new posts
* paging
