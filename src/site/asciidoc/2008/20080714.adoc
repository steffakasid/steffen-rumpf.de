â€¦ transfering german sayings into english roxx ðŸ™‚ Jear last weakend we (Kim, Rainer, Kerstin and me) were at the wedding of my cousin Anne. I think it was the loveliest wedding were I ever was invited (ok, that arenâ€™t so much but I think for the coming weddings it will be hard to beat that). But let me start on the beginning.

I started in Mannheim at 5:33 pm and had much luck because there was an ICE accident on Thursday evening (I think it was there, maybe it was ealier) and much of the ICEâ€™s coming from Cologne has a delay. So even the ICE what I decided to use. But my luck was, that the ICE which was schedduled for 16.33 had one hour delay so it arrives when I was at Manheim main station ðŸ™‚ It was a little bit cramed but I was in and started to go to Ulm. Where I arrived at ca. 7.13 pm. Sadly I missed my follow up train that should bring me to Herbrechtingen. So I had to wait for 45 minnutes. When I was there my cousin Florian picks me up there an we drove to the hotel where I had booked a room. At the evening we were in a pizzeria in the same town (What a funny evening ðŸ˜€ donâ€™t give Rainer a flapper). On satuarday was the wedding. So after breakfirst we drove to the church in Herbrechtingen.

I was really suprised about the divine service (catolic) the pastor was very unformal and acquires us often to laugh ðŸ™‚ Its not so often (in my opinion), that a pastor is able to make such a funny thing. After church the party starts. Iâ€™m not willing to tell all the details but I must repeat myself, this party was a lot of fun. Much cute people and a pleasant bridal couple makes the evening perfect.

Here are some pictures from the day:

â€¦ pictures will follow soon â€¦

The party ends up at night until 4 am, so on sunday morning (we had to stand up at 10 am for breakfirst â€“ I made it at 10.30am ðŸ™‚ ) we was all very wearyâ€¦

So after all I have to say: Good luck and much Children for you: Anne and Jochen ðŸ˜‰
