After playing around with some custom written webpages (by myself) and testin some content management systems (CMS) I desided to create a blog. First hit I get searchin an open source blog by google was WordPress… so here it is. Easy to install, easy to use, more I don’t need x) Maybe I will do a little bit customization, create my own theme and so on… we will see and may be I will write some bloggings down here so everyone can read what I’am doing xD
