I was just searching for a list of all keyboard shortcuts in Photoshop CC. I found a few links which where either to old or I was not able to print them in a nice way in chrome/iron. So I searched further and found something pretty nice:

In Photoshop CC itself you could just go to the edit/bearbeiten menu and there is an entry called shortcuts/Tastaturbefehle (Alt+Umschalt+STRG+k). From there you can export all currently defined shortcuts into a .htm file.
