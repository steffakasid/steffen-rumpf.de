== MS-Project under Linux

For those who need to work with MS-Projectfiles under Linux I've found something interesting. There is a program called OpenProject which enables you to open and view MS-Projectfiles. In another blog I found some informations, that it does not include all features offered by MS-Project but for my requirements it was good enough. So I think this could be a good alternativ to the commercial ones.
