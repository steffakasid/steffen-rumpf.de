== Customized my Blog

As you can see, I've customized my blog and created my own themeâ€¦ which is not finished at all, but for the first time it will fit my requirements. Also I've added a plugin which enables the blog to highlight source code from different programming languages. This plugin is called wp-syntax. Here are some examples:
First of all PHP:

[source,php]
----
<?php
function hello($strName) {
   echo "Hello $strName";
}
?>
----

And a second example with a unix shell script:

[source,SH]  
---- 
#!/bin/sh
var='Hello World!'
echo $var
