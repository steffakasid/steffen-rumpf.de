== Switch to gohugo and Ionos deploy now

Today I swichted this website from my custom maven plugin to use link:https://gohugo.io[gohugo] (with asciidoctor) to build the page and deploy it to link:https://www.ionos.de/hosting/deploy-now[Ionos deploy now]. This was quite easy to acomplish and I really like the outcome.
